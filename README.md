# Topguw
### About
Topguw is a little software that I made to help people who want to analyse and then crack GSM. 
Topguw works with airprobe and kalibrate-rtl. 
It makes some steps of the know-plaintext attack vector to GSM automatically (Karsten Nohl).

The actual version is currently in beta, bugs may occur but the software will works with good input datas.
V0.1

## How to install
1. Dependencies 
  -  Firstly you have to install airprobe and gsmframecoder (airprobe depends on gnu-radio **3.6**, so if you use Kali 2 for example you have 2 solution -> downgrade to kali 1 or use the zmiana).
  -  You should install kalibrate-rtl too (Topguw uses kal command to scan GSM tower).
  -  Not really a dependencies, just to tell you that I use Oracle JDK 1.8 to run Topguw.

2. Run
  -  From a shell, you can start the jar with "java -jar Topguw.jar" 
  -  Use Netbean to import the project and run from Netbean, main class is Principal.java
