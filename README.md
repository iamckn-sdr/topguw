# Topguw
### About
Topguw is a little software that I made to help people who want to analyse and then crack GSM. 
Topguw works with airprobe and kalibrate-rtl. 
It makes some steps of the know-plaintext attack vector to GSM automatically (Karsten Nohl).

## How to install
1. Dependencies 
  1. Firstly you have to install airprobe and gsmframecoder (airprobe depends on gnu-radio **3.6**, so if you use Kali 2 for example you have 2 solution -> downgrade to kali 1 or use the zmiana).
  2. You should install kalibrate-rtl too (Topguw uses kal command to scan GSM tower).

2. Run
  1. From a shell start the jar with "java -jar Topwub.jar"
  2. Use Netbean to import the project and run from Netbean

## How to use
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
